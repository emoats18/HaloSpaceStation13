	elected president. One would consider this to be the perfect UEG world, but this isn't quite the case. The Gao Charter declares \
	their sovereignty, and requires all members of government to oppose anyone who would dare impeach their freedom. Their primary \
	tactics and doctorine focus stealth, infiltration and sabotage, which has won them many \"battles\" in the past without having to \
	fire a single bullet, instead burning the supplies of their enemies and forcing them to starve or surrender. They have tried on \
	a few occasions to justify conflict against the UNSC, with little success. Despite this, they remain one of the most technologically \
	advanced competitors to the UNSC, and maintain public support for the Insurrection movement. Their supplies are invaluable to the \
	insurrection, and assist wherever they can through their agents in the Ministry of Protection. Democracy may slow their action, \
	but they will never stop until the UNSC submits to the freedom fighters they support."
