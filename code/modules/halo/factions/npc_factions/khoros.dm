		sands of time, only those who leave their marks on the land are ever remembered, atleast more so then simple \
		skeletal remains. In such a cruel land, only the strongest can survive, and the weak will perish. Such philosophy \
		embodies the Khoros Desert Raiders, who chose to operate outside the walls of Talista's capital and instead make \
		their home on the moon's many mountains. Raids are constant, and most who venture outside of the safe walls never \
		return. And for what purpose? Many claim they need the supplies, but in reality, they do it to prove their strength, \
		and to satisfy their passion for battle. Justifying their violent tendencies like a simple hobby, they are resolute \
		in proving their strength and satisfying their desire for war. Despite the might of the UNSC, they dare not step \
		under the shadow of the mountains or head out to rescue a dammed trading convoy. After all, only the strong can rule \
		over the weak. "
