/*
This is the first implementation of the new jobsystem.
Basic jobs are all defined in the halo modules folder and used by default in all gamemodes and maps.
If a gamemode or map needs to do something slightly different, copy the procedure below by making the slight adjustment needed.
This will keep jobs and outfits consistent across the server, while also reducing code bloat.
