///////////////////////// ABOUT THE SUBMAPS FOLDER /////////////////////////

//Do not put your gamemode-related maps in there! This folder is dedicated to NPC quest instances.
//Map size for these instances must be 30x30, no less, no more! (Unless approved by Cael)

//Also make sure to respect the faction folders. Do not put insurrectionist submaps into the unsc folder.
//Put them in their respectiver folder. This is to ensure easy search of submaps.

//Your maps may be an open field or an entire building closed off by walls.
//Placing a door to access the instance isn't necessary if you want to players to break into the building,
//however the walls must be simulated (simulated walls can be destroyed, unsimulated cannot; keep that in mind)

//Example maps aren to be used! Do not modify them.

//The CIVILIAN subfolder is meant for multi-purposes map, especially those that do not strictly apply to a faction setting!
//If your instance can be used for any and all faction, chances are it belongs in this folder.
